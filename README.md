# Hedge-Fund-Replication

This project aims to replicate the returns of the mains hedge fund indexes using Kalman filters and Risk Premias.

## First part - state of the art on classical methods

we first try to replicate the HFRX Equity Neutral Index with a simple OLS regression on various benchmark such as
the SX5E, S&P500, DAX, FSTE etc ... the result can be found in here
